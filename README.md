_Project Aim-_
To create a website with a real-world purpose, I set out to make a website that could compose emails, draft report card comments, and generate lesson ideas for teachers.

_Built using_
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and the OpenAI API.

_What I Learned_
How to create a project in GitHub projects, use a Jira board, and use GitHub Desktop more confidently. I also learned how to use the smoothscroll function using JS, add forms on Netlify, and set up Google Analytics. Using Bootstrap enabled me to have a site that was mobile-responsive and pretty decent-looking from the start.

_Using the OpenAI API_
I had used the OpenAI API in one of my previous projects (based on Tristan Wolff's tutorial for using a jQuery terminal to obtain input from a user, communicate the input to the API and process the response). However, this time I worked to have the user input be supplied through a form on the webpage, and to have the output appear on the page once the response was obtained from the API. I learned a little about prompt engineering to enable me to generate responses specifically for teachers. I also tried using the different models on offer from OpenAI, and although ada, curie and babbage models gave much faster responses than 'davinci', their responses were absolute rubbish! ðŸ˜‚

_Plans for the Future_
As I learn more backend development I plan to add more to this website so that it can grow and evolve. e.g. addition of authentication, user profiles and saving and retreiving of data.
